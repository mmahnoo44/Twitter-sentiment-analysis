Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning
This project use TensorFlow and deep learning techniques to do sentiment analysis on Twitter data.  a model that, given the content of a tweet, can categorize it as positive or negative.
The process of determining and classifying the sentiment expressed in text data is known as sentiment analysis. In this project, we particularly concentrate on sentiment analysis of Twitter tweets
Data Used
The Kaggle dataset used for this project consists of labeled Twitter tweets, where each tweet is categorized as positive, negative
